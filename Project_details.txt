My best project ever iscalled The Vault which is a cross platform flutter mobile application that is used to store and retrieve the files that you choose in cloud. 
You can download and view those files at anytime you wish . 
Vault is an application which is made exclusively to store files for free and can access them easily whenever needed..
Vault is a app similar to google drive which gives you the storage of 516 MB .Here you can store files like images and pdf as in for now.You can STORE and VIEW your files here . Currently the app supports upload files feature with preview of documents and images and also download feature of all files, also search option for easy navigation to files will be added in future.

It also has a favourites option thorugh which people can choose there favourite files can view them in a different page. There are other featurees like updating profile , deleting profile,

We are also planning to add a feature wherein the user can save all the important docs in encrypted form and share the desirable files through a link , also video preview will be avaiable in future both in app as well as website.
